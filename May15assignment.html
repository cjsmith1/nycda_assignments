			A Bakersfield, California boy suffered only minor injuries after what could have been a tragic dog attack was thwarted...by the family cat.

			<a href="http://www.turnto23.com/news/local-news/amazing-video-cat-saves-boy-from-dog-attack-in-southwest-bakersfield-051414">Harrowing</a> security camera footage taken outside of the boy and cat's home show the boy playing on his bicycle in the driveway before being attacked, unprovoked, by the neighbor's unleashed dog. But before the dog can drag the boy down the driveway, in comes family cat Tara like a bolt of righteous f***ing lightning to attack the dog and chase it away. Shortly thereafter, the boy's mother runs into the shot and picks him up. According to local Bakersfield news, the boy suffered minor injuries that required some stitches on his leg and the dog is now under observation. The cat, meanwhile, is now officially the best f***ing cat in the history of the go***mn world. Seriously. I've had cats my entire life and they've all been delightful a**holes who would probably watch me get murdered and then beg my murderer for a can of wet food before he leaves.

			Bakersfield's 23ABC notes that America "will be hearing from the boy, the mother and the cat later in the day."

			I will be watching entirely for the cat.
